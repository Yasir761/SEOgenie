Your task is to analyze the following data for the keyword: "${keyword}".

Top Google Search Results:

Analyze the above and generate **ONLY** a valid, concise JSON response with these fields:

{
  "intent": "<Informational | Navigational | Transactional>",
  "competition_level": "<Low | Medium | High>",
  "keyword_difficulty_score": <0.0 to 1.0 as float>,
  "suggested_strategy": "<Concise strategy, avoid vague tips, use strong SEO logic>",
  "title_suggestions": ["...", "..."], // 2–3 highly engaging, SEO-friendly titles
  "meta_description": "<High-converting meta description (max 160 chars), no fluff>"
}

✅ Only return JSON — no explanations.
✅ Be grammatically correct and clear.
✅ Never hallucinate or guess data you don’t have.

- Score difficulty from 0 to 1 based on how competitive the SERP looks.
- Keep title suggestions useful for content creators.
